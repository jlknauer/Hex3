# 1. initialize the board
# G <--- Empty 3x3 board
# Stack <--- { G }
# 
# 2. black first move (computer)
# pop G from stack
# add play(G,x) to the stack, where x is any given cell (we will place on the main diagonal)
# while stack is not empty do:
#       get opponent's move x
#       if pattern exists in G in S:
#           pop G from stack
#           add play(G,x) to stack
#       else:
#           pop any G from stack
#           add play(G,0)
