# 
# THE PLAYER - interface
# 1. initialize the board
# G <--- Empty 3x3 board
# Stack <--- { G }
# 
# 2. black first move (computer)
# pop G from stack
# add play(G,x) to the stack, where x is any given cell (we will place on the main diagonal)
# while stack is not empty do:
#       get opponent's move x
#       if pattern exists in G in S:
#           pop G from stack
#           add play(G,x) to stack
#       else:
#           pop any G from stack
#           add play(G,0)

# PATTERNS
# 
# Bridge
# Position:
#       a b
#      1 x .
#       2 . x
# Contract: create path (a1, x, b2) where x = a2 OR b1
# Strategy: if white plays b1 - black plays a2
#           else if white plays a2 - black plays b1
#           else play a2 OR b1
# Notes: consider generalizing the bridge pattern to the top/bottom, where a cell is paired to 
#       an edge cell
#
# Pair
# Position:
#       a b c
#      1 . . .
#       2 . x .
#        3 . . .      
# Contract: create pair (a1, b2) OR (b2, c3)
# Strategy: if white plays a1 - black plays c3   
#           else if white plays c3 - black plays a1
#           else play a1 OR c3
